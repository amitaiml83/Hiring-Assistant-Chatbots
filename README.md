# Technical Interview Evaluation System Chatbots using AI

## Overview
The **Technical Interview Evaluation System** is a Streamlit-based web application designed to streamline the technical interview process. It collects candidate details, generates technical questions based on their chosen tech stack, evaluates their responses using AI, provides feedback, assigns scores, and saves all responses in a structured format.

## Features
- **Candidate Data Collection:** Inputs for name, email, phone number, experience, desired position, location, and tech stack.
- **AI-Generated Technical Questions:** Uses the Hugging Face model `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` to generate relevant questions.
- **Automated Answer Evaluation:** Evaluates candidate responses using AI, providing feedback and scores.
- **Score Calculation:** Assigns scores based on answer correctness and depth.
- **JSON Data Storage:** Saves responses and scores for record-keeping.
- **Streamlit UI:** Simple and interactive user interface for seamless interview assessment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python
- **AI Model:** Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Hugging Face)
- **Database:** JSON file storage
